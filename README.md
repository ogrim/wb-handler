# wb-handler

`wb-handler` is a small Clojure project to perform tasks on the WeeklyBeats.com RSS feed, such as populating a database with the data or only download the tracks from your favorite artists.

## Usage

Default database is sqlite `database.db`, but this can be changed in `wb-handler.db`. Run `(create-db)` in `wb-handler.db` to make the sqlite database, and populate it with `(insert-week i)` in `wb-handler.core`.
