# wb-handler

`wb-handler` is a small Clojure project to perform tasks on the WeeklyBeats.com RSS feed, such as populating a database with the data or only download the tracks from your favorite artists.

## Usage

Download your favorite artists tracks by calling `download-favorites-week` with week number and a coll of the artist names, which are case sensitivem like so: `(download-favorites-week i ["trash80" "Dos.Putin"])`. This rebinds the `*favorite-artists*` var, which will be used if you only call the function with a week number. See what weeks are available with `(available-weeks)`, and update the RSS feed by calling `(p/update-rss-feed!)`.

Default database is sqlite `database.db`, but this can be changed in `wb-handler.db`. Run `(create-db)` in `wb-handler.db` to make the sqlite database, and populate it with `(insert-week i)`.
